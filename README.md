# Why-Prettier-does-not-format-code-in-VSCODE-


How I've sorted it after having super huge frustrations with Prettier stopping working in VSCode.

Select VS Code -> View -> Command Palette, and type: Format Document With
Then Configure Default Formatter... and then choose Prettier - Code formatter.
This sorted the problem for me magically.
